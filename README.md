# Research prime numbers

Okay, so here's a code to find prime numbers. I made a post about prime I found up until 10^8. 

(Go check the code) I think you understand very well that it's thanks to the "ListP" and the intervall of calculus. I only have a very slow pc since they're given by my highschool, so I was able to generate the primes in different steps (start generating primes in [0; 10^3], then [10^3; 10^6], [10^6; 10^7] and finally [10^7; 10^8] while increasing my ListP with the previous primes found). Maybe you have a nice and fast pc; those steps might be facultative (and I hope so)! 

I made a instruction creating a .txt file to help you save your previous generations!

I hope you like it!
